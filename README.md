Module 4 Challenge

## Background
As the Chief Data Scientist for my local government area, I am helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

This project will analyse the area-wide standardised test results. They are specifically looking at the students' math and reading scores with the addition of various information on the schools they attend, giving an aggregated showcase of obvious trends in school performance.

## The Analysis

* Local Government Area (LGA) Summary
* School summary
* Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
* Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
* Maths Scores by Year
* Reading Scores by Year
* Scores by School Spending
* Scores by School Size
* Scores by School Type

## Written Report

The included report includes a summary of the analysis and two conclusions or comparisons from the calculations.
